## About

ChatWithTheGraph is an open-source project built for the Graph Protocol ecosystem that allows users to ask ChatGPT to visualize their data and then our frontend displays the results.

We queried the Messart NFT Marketplace subgraphs defined in this schema: https://github.com/messari/subgraphs/blob/master/schema-nft-marketplace.graphql
Such as:
https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/AwoxEZbiWLvv6e3QdvdMZw4WDURdGbvPfHmZRc8Dpfz9?view=Playground&chain=mainnet
https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/GvgkY82DTAkYqRShBbPQMjF1WJyUcknXre3QPWiXrPnS?view=Playground&chain=mainnet

Example graph queries are defined here: https://github.com/marissaposner/graph-hackathon-2023/blob/main/graphql_examples.py
