## About

ChatWithTheGraph is an open-source project built for The Graph Protocol ecosystem that allows users to ask ChatGPT to visualize their data and then our frontend displays the results.

Subgraphs we used: 

We queried the Messart NFT Marketplace subgraphs defined in this schema: https://github.com/messari/subgraphs/blob/master/schema-nft-marketplace.graphql
Such as:
https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/AwoxEZbiWLvv6e3QdvdMZw4WDURdGbvPfHmZRc8Dpfz9?view=Playground&chain=mainnet

Example graph queries are defined here: https://github.com/marissaposner/graph-hackathon-2023/blob/main/graphql_examples.py

## Getting Started

This is split between 2 services, a frontend and a backend

# Running the backend
- Install Python version management tool: [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
- Install `Python 3.9.14` using the Python version management tool and activate that version
- Setup the backend, ensure you have python 3.9 or great installed
- `git submodule update --init --recursive` to clone (or update) the `subgraphs` repo in `backend/`
- `cd backend` and run the following steps:
  - run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Install app requirements)
  - run `pip install -e .` (Install the 'backend' package)
  - Setup .env by copying .env.example to .env and seed with correct data
  - Setup the database with `flask db upgrade`
  - Start the backend app with `flask run`
- Visit http://localhost:5000

## Database Debugging
### Database issues "sqlalchemy.exc.StatementError: (builtins.ValueError) Value"
Try deleting your `backend/instance` folder, then `flask db upgrade` to bring a new database up to
the latest app schema.


# Running the frontend

- For the frontend:`cd frontend` and then run `npm install` (note if you run into any issues you can run `npm install --force`)
